# Sleep EEG Event Detector (SEED)

This repository will soon host the code and pretrained weights for our deep-learning based detector (SEED) described in our paper titled "A Robust Deep Learning Detector for Sleep Spindles and K-Complexes: Towards
Population Norms", recently accepted for publication in Scientific Reports.
